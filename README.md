# usePopcorn App

A React-based movie tracker application that allows users to search for movies, view details, rate movies and manage a list of watched movies. This app integrates with the OMDb API to fetch movie data and utilizes localStorage to persist watched movies across sessions. This project was developed as part of the React Course by Jonas Schmedtmann and focuses on using `useState`, `useEffect`, and creating custom Hooks.

## Features

- **Search for Movies**: Users can search for movies using a query, and results are fetched from the OMDb API.
- **View Movie Details**: Users can view detailed information about a selected movie.
- **Rate Movies**: Users can rate a movie, and the rating will be saved in the watched list. This rating can be updated later.- **Track Watched Movies**: Users can add movies to their watched list and view a summary of their watched movies.
- **Manage Watched List**: Users can remove movies from their watched list and see statistics such as average ratings and runtime.
